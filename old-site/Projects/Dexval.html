            Being a Type 1 Diabetic, a CGM is necessary for my day to day life. 
            The Dexcom allows me to see my blood glucose levels throughout the day. 
            Things like a Time in Range percentage and A1C estimator keep me alive and help 
            make sure I am staying healthy.
            Through a sensor on my body, a transmitter reads the level given to it by the sensor
            and then transmits the number to my phone using Dexcom's cloud database.
            Using Dexcom's g6 mobile app I can see this data, up to 24 hours.
            Using Dexcom's Clarity mobile app I can see the data for the past year.
            However, I am looking to do more than what the Clarity app does.
            I want to learn how my habits, trends, and other factors can influence
            my data. As of right now, all I can do is display data, but in the
            future I hope to have even more functionality than apps like Sugarmate 
            and Clarity<br><br>

            Example output using main.py:<br><br>
            Your current glucose level is 136 mg/dL (steady â†’)<br>
            Time of reading: 2024-04-18 13:07:31<br>
            Glucose state: In Range<br>
            Average glucose level: 141.5451 mg/dL<br>
            Estimated A1C: 9.484<br>
            Time in Range (70-150 mg/dL): 58.33%<br><br>
