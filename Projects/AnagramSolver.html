          <p>
              Due to my love for Scrabble, I created an Anagram solver for the game.<br>
              Out of the 7 letters you have in your deck, the solver will tell you<br>
              all the possible words you can play, according to the official <br>
              scrabble dictionary. <br><br>
              It is coded entirely in Java, employing HashMaps and HashSets for <br>
              fast lookup based on your letters. In Scrabble, there are space <br>
              characters that allow for any letter to be played. This adds <br>
              complexity due to the amount of permutations possible for each of 26 <br>
              letters to be compared with your stack. <br><br>
              The first version can be found here: <br><br>
              <a href="https://github.com/EricSpencer00/AnagramSolverV1">Anagram Solver V1</a>
              <br><br>
              In the second iteration there will be changes to the lookup algorithm adding<br>
              even faster lookup. As it stands for the output, all results are looked up<br>
              first and then output second after sorting. <br>
