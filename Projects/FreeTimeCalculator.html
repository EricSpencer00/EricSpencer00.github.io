            My first full-fledged project. <br><br>
            Here's how it works: enter in the start of the time you or a friend is available for
            a given day, (say 4-6pm and 8-10pm) then, enter in a second person's available time
            (5-9pm). Once inputted, the program will print the time spreadsheet to the console and also
            return the hours that everyone is available. The program works for up to four people at once.
            <br><br>
            The design, implementation, and testing was all performed by me,<br> coded with Java.

            <strong>Workings and Caveats</strong><br>
            Utilized a 2-D Array that looped over a set of data the user provided.
            Was difficult to implement due to the nature of 10, 11, and 12 A.M. and P.M.
            Coded entirely inside a JVM.

            Unfortunately, due to the way the code was stored,
            on the school's virtual machine, I lost access to the source.
            Fortunately, this video exists of me doing a sample for
            the class: <br>
