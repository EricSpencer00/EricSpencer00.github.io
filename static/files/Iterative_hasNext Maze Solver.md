# Iterative Maze Solver Example

This file contains an example and discussion of an iterative (BFS-based) maze solver in Java, suitable for a CS2 course.

---

## Example Code and Explanation

```
import java.util.ArrayDeque;
import java.util.Queue;

public class MazeSolver { ... }
```

- The maze uses '*' for walls, ' ' for unvisited spaces, and 'x' for visited spaces.
- The algorithm uses a queue for BFS, marking visited cells and checking for the exit.
- See the original `.txt` for full Q&A and details.
