# Recursive Maze Solver Example

This file contains an example and discussion of a recursive maze solver in Java, suitable for a CS2 course.

---

## Example Code and Explanation

```
public class MazeSolver { ... }
```

- The maze uses '*' for walls, '.' for unvisited, '-' for dead-ends, '0' for start, and '+' for visited.
- The algorithm uses recursion to explore paths, marking dead-ends and the solution path.
- See the original `.txt` for full Q&A and details.
