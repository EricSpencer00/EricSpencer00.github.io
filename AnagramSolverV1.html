            Due to my love for Scrabble, I created an Anagram solver for the game.
            Out of the 7 letters you have in your deck, the solver will tell you
            all the possible words you can play, according to the official
            scrabble dictionary.
            It is coded entirely in Java, employing HashMaps and HashSets for
            fast lookup based on your letters. In Scrabble, there are space
            characters that allow for any letter to be played. This adds
            complexity due to the amount of permutations possible for each of 26
            letters to be compared with your stack. <br><br>
            The first version can be found here: <br><br>

            <br><br>
            In the second iteration there will be changes to the lookup algorithm adding
            even faster lookup. As it stands for the output, all results are looked up
            first and then output second after sorting.
