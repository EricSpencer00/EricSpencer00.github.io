This website showcases my web-dev skills in action. Using Hugo pages, I easily convert Markdown files into repeatable html. There's some custom modifications to the [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) that I've adapted to my own tastes such as the project image previews and grid. Compare [this PaperMod example page](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/) and my [projects page](https://ericspencer00.github.io/projects/). I've open sourced this website at [https://github.com/EricSpencer00/EricSpencer00.github.io](https://github.com/EricSpencer00/EricSpencer00.github.io), feel free to clone the repo and add your own information in place of mine.

Some professional information about me includes my experience working in Software Engineering, Information Technology, and Research. I enjoy problem solving, so working in tech allows me to do what I love ❤️. 

I'm a Computer Science and Information Systems student at Loyola University Chicago, graduating May 2026. 

Some of my favorite projects of mine include my formal methods [interactive microwave](https://ericspencer00.github.io/projects/2025/interactive-microwave-tla/) using TLA+ and a JVM, my [VSC extension](https://ericspencer00.github.io/projects/2025/flatten-repo/) that allows you to paste your smallish codebase into a web-based LLM if you ran out of Cursor or Copilot credits, and my [terminal ChatGPT wrapper](https://ericspencer00.github.io/projects/2025/terminalgpt/).
