# Neural Network Image Recognition Project

In this project, I explored the fascinating world of computer vision using neural networks. The goal was to create a system that could identify and classify various objects in images with high accuracy.

## Key Features

- Custom CNN architecture built from scratch
- Training on a diverse dataset of 10,000 images
- Real-time object detection capabilities
- Accuracy rate of 94% on test data

## Technical Implementation

The project utilized PyTorch for the neural network implementation, with a focus on:
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Max pooling for dimensionality reduction
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Softmax activation for classification

## Results and Insights

The model demonstrated particularly strong performance in:
- Natural scene recognition
- Object detection in varying lighting conditions
- Real-time processing capabilities

This project was a great learning experience in understanding the complexities of computer vision and neural network architecture.
