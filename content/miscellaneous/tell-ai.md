As AI makes our lives easier, we see more and more of it. This is not to shame anyone who uses AI. These are just a few tells that you can use to know if something is AI, so you can say, "Hey, this is probably AI!" and then do nothing else. Know that I often use AI-generated READMEs and summarizations for my own ease. These are some observations I've noticed more and more within the past year.

### It's not just X, It's Y!

As I've read more and more content online I've noticed this sentence structure more and more often. I hadn't noticed this before a couple of months ago. So, maybe more and more people are generating summaries with AI that use this sentence structure. Personally, I'm sick of it already.

### üìù Emojis

Asking ChatGPT to generate a markdown file with a list of topics is an easy way to prove this one. It will often give you a title with an emoji next to it. I don't think anybody would go out of their way to mark EVERY topic with a custom emoji for something such as a summary of what you think about B2B SaaS tools, like I often see on LinkedIn. Honestly, I enjoy the emojis on most lists of topics. It provides a visual cue of what the topic is in your peripheral vision, something that does a better job than a word or two about the topic. The only problem is having the correct emoji for your topic.

### The em dash

I remember using an em dash all the way back in freshman year of high school for an English paper (~7 years ago). It was even then I was worried the teacher might think I was copying a source from the internet. It wasn't something I was taught but had picked up from reading articles online. So, for it to be a telltale sign of AI use today doesn't surprise me at all.  

I caution myself using it now for that reason and instead use a stupid amount of parenthesis for when I want to make a sidepoint during a sentence (like how I did right here).
