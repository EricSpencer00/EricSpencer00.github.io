During my first Hackathon at Northwestern's **Wildhacks**, my team and I collaborated on a **mental wellness application**. The app allows users to chat with others about their wellness on a **message board**.  

While the app itself doesn't do much, it was a **valuable learning experience** in working with others and producing something comprehensive.  

### Team Contributions:
- **Matt** worked on the **backend Firebase** to allow users to login and comment to a database.
- **Leann** designed the **website layout**, deciding where elements should be placed and how users navigate the site.
- **Isaiah and I** worked with **HTML and CSS** to make the UI functional.
- I also **starred in, directed, and edited** the video shown above.
