<hr>

Being a **Type 1 Diabetic**, a **Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)** is necessary for my daily life.  
The **Dexcom** allows me to track my **blood glucose levels** throughout the day.  
Key metrics like **Time in Range percentage** and **A1C estimator** help ensure I stay healthy.  

Through a sensor on my body, a **transmitter reads glucose levels** and sends the data to my phone via **Dexcom's cloud database**.  
- **Dexcom G6 mobile app**: Displays data for the past **24 hours**  
- **Dexcom Clarity app**: Displays data for the past **year**  

However, I want to go beyond **Clarity's capabilities**.  
I aim to analyze **habits, trends, and other influencing factors** to gain deeper insights into my glucose patterns.  

Right now, this project **displays Dexcom data**, but I hope to expand its functionality to **outperform apps like Sugarmate and Clarity** in the future.
