### 🏗 My First Full-Fledged Project

This project helps people find **overlapping free time** in their schedules.  

#### 🕒 How It Works:
1. Enter your **availability** for a given day (e.g., `4-6pm` and `8-10pm`).
2. Enter a second person's availability (e.g., `5-9pm`).
3. The program **prints a time spreadsheet** and calculates when **everyone is available**.
4. Works for **up to four people** at once.

---

### 🔧 Workings & Caveats:
- Utilized a **2-D Array** to process user-provided schedules.
- Handling **AM/PM time conversions** (especially 10, 11, and 12) was challenging.
- **Coded entirely inside a JVM**.

### 📽 Demo Video:
Unfortunately, the **source code was lost** due to it being stored on my school's virtual machine.  
However, a **sample run** of the program was recorded:
