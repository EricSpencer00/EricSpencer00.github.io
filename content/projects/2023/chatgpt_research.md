During the summer of 2023, I contributed to research at Loyola regarding how ChatGPT understood CS2 data structures (defined from Pearson, the publisher, as the second Computer Science course in common curriculum--CS1 is akin to AP Computer Science A).  

I was given the task of evaluating responses from ChatGPT and compiling them 



Inspired by my CS2 class about maze searching algorithms I chose that to explore first.
