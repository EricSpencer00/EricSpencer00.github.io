Before I knew what the point of Git versioning was, I created an entirely new repo for the sake of creating a new version of my previous anagram solver.

Key improvements include the use of a faster Trie search algorithm and effective Scrabble assistance by calculating the score of each word.

Simply add your Scrabble letters to this program and see the best possible word you can create.

Now, If I were to make a V3, I would include the ability to insert your Scrabble board for the absolute best possible play you could create.
