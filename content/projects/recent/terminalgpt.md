### gpt.py
Once you hook up an OpenAI model (using paid credits or using a free API with limits), you can chat with it inside the terminal, perfect if you hate the buggy web versions and want to integrate as much as you can into the terminal.

### exe.py
The perfect tool for executing commands from English to Bash. If you're new to the terminal and have enough savy to getting the venv set up but not any other commands, then this program is for you. Using a wrapper, give exe.py the problem you want to solve in your terminal and generate a solution with an OpenAI model. There is a confirmation in any command that's generated, so don't worry about rm -rfing your directory.
