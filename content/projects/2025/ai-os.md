My Operating Systems final project was an AI enabled operating system on a VM. Basically, setting up an Ollama server on the host machine, creating a web server to serve our vm, initializing a driver along with memory, compiling Python apps to run on Ubuntu, and making sure everything can talk to each other in a reproducable way. 

Our hero of the day is the ./auraos.sh script which can setup everything required for the VM to run and develop on. It installs everything from Python environments to making sure ports are open and working.
