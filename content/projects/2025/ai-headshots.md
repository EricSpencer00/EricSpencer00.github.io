During May of this year, I started toying with the idea of a SaaS business. My plan was to create an headshot generator using Replicate. Basically, an AI wrapper. I was half committed to the idea of charging a 1000% markup for my services for essentially a worse version of what Replicate could do (since Replicate inference was pennies for an image) The other half of me wanted to complete the MVP just to practice working with CloudFlare and real business uses of software. The state that the project was left in almost worked but didn't provide that great of results. However, since this was made before image generation advancements available just a few months later, I may pick up the project again. One problem that needs to be addressed is "Why can't I just go to Gemini, ChatGPT, or Replicate and get a headshot for free?" I only want to release paid software if it is something that I would actually feel comfortable paying for if I was a customer. The only thing users would waste is their time, not their money. 

Another aspect of this business is that it would need to capture attention fast, and for cheap. Replicate could suddenly charge $1 per call instead of 1 cent or simply change their terms of service and the business wouldn't be feasible anymore. The lean model would mean cutting losses, or even pivoting, easy.
