If you've ever needed to give an LLM context for multiple files as you code, then you know how tedious it is
to copy and paste all of the files into the LLM window.

This Visual Studio Code extension lets you compile all of your files into a single .txt file.

Using glob patterns you can include or exclude files that wouldn't be helpful for an LLM context (such as
build files and libraries).

[![Publish Extension](https://github.com/EricSpencer00/flatten-repo/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EricSpencer00/flatten-repo/actions/workflows/publish.yml)

**Flatten your entire codebase into clean, readable `.txt` files — optimized for LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.**

---

## ✨ Features (v0.0.12)

- 🔁 Auto-flattens your workspace into plain `.txt` chunks
- 🧠 Built for LLM parsing, prompt engineering, and static code analysis
- 📂 Each chunk includes a **directory tree** overview of included files
- ✂️ Auto-chunks content using a configurable **token limit** (~4 characters per token)
- 🔍 Powerful support for glob-based **ignore**, **whitelist**, and **blacklist**
- 🧾 All configs live in a single `.flatten_ignore` file (generated automatically)
- ⚙️ Customize file extensions, folders to ignore, and token size limits
- 📁 Output saved in timestamped files under `/flattened`
- 🚫 Auto-adds `/flattened` to your `.gitignore`

> Each chunk starts with a tree-like outline of included files, followed by:
>  
> `=== FILE: path/to/file.ext ===`

---

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Open a folder in VS Code
2. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
3. Run: `Flatten Project to TXT`
4. View flattened files inside the `/flattened` folder

---

## 🛠️ Configuration

You can configure behavior in your `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
"flattenRepo.includeExtensions": [".ts", ".tsx", ".js", ".jsx", ".py", ".html", ".css"],
"flattenRepo.ignoreDirs": ["node_modules", ".git", "dist"],
"flattenRepo.maxChunkSize": 200000
```

Or configure per-project settings via `.flatten_ignore`.

---

## 📄 .flatten_ignore

This single file controls:
- ✅ Glob-based `global` ignore rules
- ➕ Optional `whitelist` or `blacklist`
- 📐 Token limits via a `settings:` section

Auto-generated in `/flattened` if missing.

### 🔁 Sample `.flatten_ignore`

```txt
# Ignore rules
global:
node_modules
.git
dist

# Whitelist (optional)
whitelist:
src/**/*.js

# Blacklist (optional)
blacklist:
**/*.test.js
.env

# Settings (optional)
settings:
maxTokenLimit: 50000
maxTokensPerFile: 25000

# Suggestions:
#   Claude 3.7: 128k tokens
#   ChatGPT 4o: 128k tokens
#   ChatGPT o3-mini-high: 200k tokens
#   Claude 2: 100k tokens
#   Anthropic Claude 3 Opus: 200k tokens
#   Cohere Command: 32k tokens
#   Google PaLM 2: 8k tokens
#   Meta LLaMA 2: 4k tokens
```

## 📐 Output Format

Each `.txt` output file looks like this:

```
=== Directory Tree ===
├─ App.tsx
├─ index.js
└─ components
   ├─ Header.tsx
   └─ Footer.tsx

=== FILE: App.tsx ===
import React from 'react';
...
```

---

## ✅ Use Cases

- Preparing source code for LLM input
- Clean context formatting for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.
- Snapshotting your repo for AI audits or static reviews
- Prompt engineering pipelines
- Code flattening for full-project memory with agents

---

## 🐞 Known Limitations

- No graphical UI (yet) — command-only
- Does not flatten binary or image files
- Some advanced glob edge cases may need refinement
