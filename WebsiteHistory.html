    <h1>Website History</h1>
    <p>
        I knew this website was going to be simple, being my first time making one. I didn't want to copy
        any CSS frameworks and pass that off as my own. I wanted to learn how to position &lt;div&gt; elements
        and other design elements by myself without having a guideline. Of course, I couldn't reinvent the wheel
        so I took some light inspiration from the times of the internet where CSS wasn't widely used.

        Some examples of this can be found for any major company who's been around for more than 20 years. Just
        paste their URL into Web Archive's <a href="https://archive.org">WayBack Machine</a>.<br><br>
